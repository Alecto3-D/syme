  <dt style="font-weight: bold">So what does Syme offer?</dt>
  <dd>It sets up disposable EC2 nodes for collaborating on GitHub
  projects via <kbd>ssh</kbd> and <kbd>tmux</kbd>.</dd>
</dl>

<hr>

<ol>
  <li>Enter the name of a GitHub repo. (Authorize Syme via GitHub if you haven't already.)</li>
  <li>Enter your AWS credentials and names of GitHub users to invite.</li>
  <li>SSH into the instance once it's booted using the command shown and launch <kbd>tmux</kbd>.</li>
  <li>Send the login info to the users you have invited.</li>
</ol>

  <dt style="font-weight: bold">How does it work?</dt>
  <dd>SSH public keys are fetched via GitHub profiles, so all
    collaborators must have a key pair with the public key
    uploaded to GitHub. EC2 instances are launched and configured
    via <a href="http://palletops.com/">Pallet</a>. The Syme codebase
    is <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/syme/blob/master/src/syme/instance.clj">free
    software</a>, so you are welcome to inspect its implementation
    and contribute improvements.</dd>

  <dt style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1em;">Is it safe?</dt>
  <dd>Your AWS credentials are kept in an encrypted cookie in your
    browser and aren't stored server-side beyond the scope of your
    request. You should avoid forwarding your SSH agent to Syme
    instances since it will be accessible to collaborators.</dd>

  <dt style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1em;">All this for free?</dt>
  <dd>Sort of. You will be billed by Amazon for EC2 time (m1.small)
    until the instance is terminated, which you can do through Syme or
    over SSH via <kbd>sudo halt</kbd>. But Syme itself doesn't cost
    anything.</dd>

<p>Syme is inspired by <a href="http://pair.io">pair.io</a>.</p>
