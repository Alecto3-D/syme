  <dd>It sets up disposable EC2 nodes for collaborating on GitHub
  projects via <kbd>ssh</kbd> and <kbd>tmux</kbd>.</dd>
</dl>

<hr>

<ol>
  <li>Enter the name of a GitHub repo. (Authorize Syme via GitHub if you haven't already.)</li>
  <li>Enter your AWS credentials and names of GitHub users to invite.</li>
  <li>SSH into the instance once it's booted using the command shown and launch <kbd>tmux</kbd>.</li>
  <li>Send the login info to the users you have invited.</li>
</ol>

  <dt style="font-weight: bold">How does it work?</dt>
  <dd>SSH public keys are fetched via GitHub profiles, so all
    collaborators must have a key pair with the public key uploaded to
    GitHub. The Syme codebase
    is <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/syme/blob/master/src/syme/instance.clj">free
    software</a>, so you are welcome to inspect its implementation and
    contribute improvements.</dd>

  <dt style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1em;">Is it safe?</dt>
  <dd>Your AWS credentials are kept in an encrypted cookie in your
    browser and aren't stored server-side beyond the scope of your
    request. Forwarded SSH agents are disabled since otherwise
    collaborators would be able to hijack them, so Git access should
    be done over HTTPS instead. This means you'll have to enter your
    password when you push. If you don't trust Syme with your full AWS
    credentials you can provide credentials
    to <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2011/02/aws-identity-access-management-login-console.html">IAM
    account</a> that only has permissions to launch instances. By
    default only the SSH port is open, but if you want to open others
    you can do so from
    the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-west-2#s=Instances">AWS
    EC2 console</a>.</dd>

  <dt style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1em;">All this for free?</dt>
  <dd>Sort of. You will be billed by Amazon for EC2 time (m1.small)
    until the instance is halted, which you can do through Syme or
    over SSH via <kbd>sudo halt</kbd>. But Syme itself doesn't cost
    anything. You may want to periodically check
    your <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-west-2#s=Instances">AWS
    EC2 console</a> to ensure you aren't billed for instances you
    intended to stop that stayed running due to problems with Syme. In
    particular this is common with timeout errors.</dd>
